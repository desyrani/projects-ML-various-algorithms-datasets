**Overview**

This repository demonstrates the application of various machine learning algorithms on different datasets. The project includes the following algorithms:

1. Logistic Regression vs Support Vector Machine (SVM) – Applied to a dataset related to tips.
2. Decision Tree – Applied to a dataset related to cars.
3. K-Means Clustering – Applied to a dataset related to employee salaries.

The purpose of this project is to compare the performance of different algorithms on distinct types of datasets, providing insights into how each algorithm performs in different scenarios.

**Key Features**

**Algorithms Applied:**

- **Logistic Regression and SVM:** Classification algorithms used to predict a target variable in a dataset related to tips.
- **Decision Tree:** A classification algorithm used to predict categories in a car dataset.
- **K-Means Clustering:** An unsupervised learning algorithm used to cluster employee salary data into different groups.

**Datasets:**

The project includes multiple real-world datasets for different use cases (tips, cars, employee salary).

**Model Evaluation:**

The models' performances are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and visualization techniques.

**Data Preprocessing:**

Data preprocessing techniques like normalization, handling missing values, and encoding categorical data are applied to make the data suitable for the models.
